# Contributing
I'd love it if you contributed! Opening issues or PRs helps me make the project grow. I'm sure there are people with way more talent than me who can add in a few features.
XKCDn is under the Contributor Covenant, and it's important anyone making contibuting adheres to it. 
## Pull Requests
This project is powered by virtualenv, so be sure to activate it before installing dependencies.
When finally making the PR, be sure to log what you added/fixed/removed in the description. It makes it easier for me to find out what the changes are if you tell me. Versioning notes: I do not use SemVer. I know it's good, but there are a few rules that I can't wrap my head around at the moment. I will increment the version number when a major or larger minor change is introduced.
