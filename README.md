## About
Currently all this does is gets you the latest comic and saves it to your specified file.
### What's the "n" for?
It's a CDN for [XKCD](https://xkcd.com). It's not really a CDN, but it's for novelty.
### Why not use [XKCD from @itsron717](https://github.com/itsron717/XKCD)?
I have no problem with you using it! I'm happy someone had the idea before me, I just wanted some more options, so I'm making my own! @itsron717's xkcd is awesome.
